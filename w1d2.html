    <p>With start-up companies dominating the west coast employment sector, my original career path is in definite need of an upgrade in the category directly related to technical skills.</p>
    <p>Over the next 6 weeks of this Web Fundamentals course, my hope is that these learned tech skills will flourish, enabling a transition ... possibly in to a new passion, a new career direction.  In any case, <strong>these newly developed skills will most definitely broaden my educational repertoire, both as a professional and as a consumer</strong>.</p>
    <p>A complete and utter newbie when it comes to web languages, coding and building websites, is how I'd describe myself.  
    <em>"Place an 'article' inside the inner 'header'?"  <strong>WTF???!!</strong></em>  This question along with millions of others is why I'm here.</p>
    <p>I am very much looking forward to building and designing websites, learning different web languages and discovering what code and style works best for me.</p>
    <p><em>Bring it on!!!  I'm <strong>SO</strong> ready for this new challenge!</em></p>
